<text xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>They corresponded to sedimentation rates (acc) of <measure type="list">0.45</measure> and <measure type="value">0.3 cm yr-1</measure> (Table 2). Beyond the middle shelf, MAR decreased sharply to <measure type="list">132</measure> and <measure type="value">44 g m-2 yr-1</measure> at St. 2 (11 S) and St. 8 (12 S), respectively. These latter values are associated with measurable <measure type="value">210</measure>Pbxs in the upper <measure type="value">3 cm</measure> only and thus indicative of sediment winnowing or resuspension, as mentioned above. A relatively low MAR of <measure type="value">128 g m-2 yr-1</measure> was also determined for St. 4 at 12 S compared to the neighbouring stations. MAR and acc tended to be higher at the deep oxygenated stations compared to <quantifiedObject id="bf026d6b-1ad3-4352-b70c-b6f5bb428109">the OMZ stations</quantifiedObject>, with acc of <measure type="value" ptr="#bf026d6b-1ad3-4352-b70c-b6f5bb428109">0.06 cm yr-1</measure> at St. 10 (12 S) and <measure type="value">0.05 cm yr-1</measure> at St. 5 (11 S). Aluminium accumulation showed similar trends to MAR, with highest values on the shelf and a pronounced increase below the OMZ (Fig. 3b).
