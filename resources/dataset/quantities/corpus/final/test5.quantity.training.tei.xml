    <p>They corresponded to sedimentation rates (acc) of <measure type="list"><num>0.45</num> and <num>0.3</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> (Table 2). Beyond the middle shelf, MAR decreased sharply to <measure type="list"><num>132</num> and <num>44</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="g m^-2 yr^-1">g m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 2 (11 S) and St. 8 (12 S), respectively. These latter values are associated with measurable <measure type="value"><num>210</num></measure>Pbxs in the upper <measure type="value"><num>3</num> <measure type="LENGTH" unit="cm">cm</measure></measure> only and thus indicative of sediment winnowing or resuspension, as mentioned above. A relatively low MAR of <measure type="value"><num>128</num> <measure type="MASS_ACCUMULATION_RATE" unit="kg m^-2 yr^-1">kg m-2 yr-1</measure></measure> was also determined for St. 4 at 12 S compared to the neighbouring stations. MAR and acc tended to be higher at the deep oxygenated stations compared to the OMZ stations, with acc of <measure type="value"><num>0.06</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 10 (12 S) and <measure type="value"><num>0.05</num> <measure type="SEDIMENTATION_RATE" unit="cm yr^-1">cm yr-1</measure></measure> at St. 5 (11 S). Aluminium accumulation showed similar trends to MAR, with highest values on the shelf and a pronounced increase below the OMZ (Fig. 3b).</p>
