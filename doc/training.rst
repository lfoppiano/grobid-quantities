Training and evaluation
=======================

As the rest of GROBID, the training data is encoded following the `TEI P5 <http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5>`_.
See :doc:`guidelines` for detailed explanations and examples.

Generation of training data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Training data generation works the same as in GROBID, with executable name ``createTrainingQuantities``,
for example:
::
   java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar trainingGeneration -dIn ~/grobid/grobid-quantities/src/test/resources/ -dOut ~/test/ resources/config/config.yml

by default the generation of training data is performed on the specified directory.
The argument ``-r`` will process all files within the subdirectories, recursively.

Help can be invoked with
::
   java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar trainingGeneration --help


The input directory can contain PDF (.pdf, scientific articles only), XML/TEI (.xml or .tei,
for patents and scientific articles) and text files (.txt).


Training
~~~~~~~~

This section describes quickly how to run the training with grobid-quantities.
The models will be saved under ``grobid-home/models/quantities`` and ``grobid-home/models/units`` respectively, make sure those directories exist.

To run the training, assuming the current directory is the ``grobid-quantities`` directory:
::
  cd PATH-TO-GROBID/grobid/grobid-quantities

The training can be invoked using gradle or via the the `java` command using the `dropwizard` command line, which offers more options.

Quantities CRF model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The trainer uses all the available training data from ``resouces/dataset/quantities/corpus/final``.

Via Gradle :
::
  ./gradlew train_quantities

Via command line:
::
  java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar training -m quantities -a train resources/config/config.yml

Units CRF model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The trainer uses all the available training data from ``resouces/dataset/units/corpus``. The training instance is the unit itself (a ``<unit></unit>`` entry in the XML training file)

Via Gradle :
::
  ./gradlew train_units

Via command line:
::
  java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar training -m units -a train resources/config/config.yml


Values CRF model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The trainer uses all the available training data from ``resouces/dataset/values/corpus``. The training instance is the unit itself (a ``<value></value>`` entry in the XML training file)

Via Gradle :
::
  ./gradlew train_values

Via command line:
::
  java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar training -m values -a train resources/config/config.yml


Quantified objects CRF model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**This model is not yet enabled at the moment because it's still WIP**

The trainer uses all the available training data from ``resouces/dataset/quantifiedObject/corpus``. The training instance is the paragraph itself (a ``<p></p>`` entry in the XML training file)

Via Gradle :
::
  ./gradlew train_quantifiedObject

Via command line:
::
  java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar training -m quantifiedObject -a train resources/config/config.yml


.. For the moment, the default training stop criteria are used. So, the training can be stopped manually after 2000 iterations, simply do a "control-C" to stop
the training and save the model produced in the latest iteration. 1000 iterations are largely enough.

.. Otherwise, the training will continue beyond several thousand iterations before stopping.


Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~

Grobid-quantities can be evaluated using a random `80/20` ratio, using an `holdout` set or using `n-fold cross-validation`.

80/20 evaluation
----------------
The 80/20 evaluation uses random 80% training data in ``resouces/dataset/MODEL_NAME/corpus`` and the remaining 20% for evaluation.

The command to run the 80/20 evaluation is:
::
  java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar training -m model_name -a train_eval resources/config/config.yml


Holdout evaluation
------------------
The holdout evaluation train the model and run the evaluation against a fixed set of training data. The training data is taken from ``resouces/dataset/MODEL_NAME/corpus`` and the evaluation data is taken from ``resouces/dataset/MODEL_NAME/evaluation``.

The command to run the holdout evauation is:
::
  java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar training -m model_name -a holdout resources/config/config.yml

N-fold cross-validation
-----------------------
The N-fold cross-validation perform the training and evaluation N times, partition the training data in N sets and using each set for evaluation while training with the rest. More detailed explanation `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)>`_.
The evaluation will then give the average scores over these n models (against test set) and for the best model which will be saved.

The command to run the n-fold cross-validation with N folds is the following:
::
  java -jar build/libs/grobid-quantities-{version}-onejar.jar training -m model_name -a nfold --fold-count N resources/config/config.yml
