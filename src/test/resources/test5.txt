They corresponded to sedimentation rates (acc) of 0.45 and 0.3 cm yr-1 (Table 2). Beyond the middle shelf, MAR decreased sharply to 132 and 44 g m-2 yr-1 at St. 2 (11 S) and St. 8 (12 S), respectively. These latter values are associated with measurable 210Pbxs in the upper 3 cm only and thus indicative of sediment winnowing or resuspension, as mentioned above. A relatively low MAR of 128 kg m-2 yr-1 was also determined for St. 4 at 12 S compared to the neighbouring stations. MAR and acc tended to be higher at the deep oxygenated stations compared to the OMZ stations, with acc of 0.06 cm yr-1 at St. 10 (12 S) and 0.05 cm yr-1 at St. 5 (11 S). Aluminium accumulation showed similar trends to MAR, with highest values on the shelf and a pronounced increase below the OMZ (Fig. 3b).
